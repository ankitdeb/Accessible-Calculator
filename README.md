This a calculating device which will accept voice as well as manual buttons input from the user and after processing it will display the output and also it will give the spoken feedback of the output.


# Broad description
we have made a two way communicating calculator. That means user can give the voice inputs as well as the manual button inputs and the result will be shown and dictated back to the user.  


In short , the calculator will have both speech to text(for voice input) and text to speech facility(for dictating the output) along with manual buttons and display boxes.
